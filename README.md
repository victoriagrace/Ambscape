# Ambscape

Ambscape is an audio application that will generate music from mouse drawings on the screne in 2 modes: background editing mode and foreground playing mode. 

In the background editing mode, users draw an image on the screen where no sound is playing. Once they are finished the drawn image on the screen is then captured and used to set a background ambient sound in playing mode.

In the foreground playing mode, users draw on top of the set background image, adding sound on top of the ambient background sound set by the background image. Drawing over objects from the background mode will trigger collision sounds.
